## Recycling-atx :recycle:

Shows you which buildings in Austin recycle and which ones do not.

This is an open-source project through [Open-Austin](http://www.open-austin.org/).

This is a fork of https://github.com/open-city/recycling.

### Developing locally

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install` - Install dependencies
3. `gulp build` - Build javascript and css assets
4. `gulp webserver` - Spin up a local webserver
5. `gulp deploy-gh-pages` - Ship it! :shipit:

### Goals for this fork are to build:

- REST API that can be hosted easily on more than just Heroku. This means:
  - No Mongo dependency. Use a relational database like Postgres (or maybe GitHub pages).
    - No memcached dependency. We can figure out scaling later.
      - https://github.com/open-austin/recycling-bin/issues/1
      - Frontend that consumes the API. It should be just static files that can be hosted on GitHub pages.

### Purpose of this fork
This repo is a front end component that consumes the API provided by https://github.com/open-austin/recycling-bin
